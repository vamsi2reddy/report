* This routine is triggered when an RFC call completes and 
* returns.  The routine uses RECEIVE to collect IMPORT and TABLE
* data from the RFC function module.  
*
* Note that the WRITE keyword is not supported in asynchronous 
* RFC.  If you need to generate a list, then your RFC function 
* module should return the list data in an internal table.  You 
* can then collect this data and output the list at the conclusion 
* of processing.
